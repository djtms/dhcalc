- Sentry skill damage is now multiplicative for M4 skills, additive for sentry bolts and rockets

-- Breakpoints are caluclated from animation frames (click "skills..." button to see the frame values for each skill). 
-- Note that some skills (ES, EF, HA) use the weapon type to calculate animation frames. 
-- Animation Frames for each skill/weapon were retrieved from the animations .zip file at http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/17070616926#8
-- Base Frames per Attack (FPA) is calculated as 60 * (frames - 1) / frames 
-- Minimum APS for a BP is calculated as Base_FPA / FPA (for that Break Point)
-- Break Point Actual APS is calculated as 60 / FPA (for that Break Point)
-- The "Break Points..." button will allow you to view all calculated breakpoints for any skill. 
-- The "DPS/Break Point Calculator..." button will show you your current BP for a skill, and what is needed for next BP
-- Note: Set "Average Firing Delay" to 0 to realize full effect from breakpoints, otherwise there will be a simulated delay between each attack (default is 50 milliseconds)

**5/12/15**
- Fixed error that prevented Kridershot+Meticulous Bolts from calculating properly

**5/8/15**
- Convention of Elements' damage buff is now discrete for each elemental damage type (as opposed to averaged across all 4 elements). It now cycles through each element every 4 seconds.

**5/7/15**

* Complete re-write of damage simulation.

- The length of the simulation is now based on monster health. The simulation runs until the primary target is dead, or the max time is exceeded.
- There is a max time of 15 simulation minutes (default is two minutes). 
* Rain of Vengeance now implemented as a DoT
- However, unlike most DoTs, RoV can stack with itself if you cast it multiple times (e.g., using Nat's 2 piece bonus)
* The simulation will attempt to pick the correct skill based on build for each time step:
- Normally a spender is chosen if there is enough hatred left, otherwise it will use a generator
- If using Focus & Restraint, it will normally use a spender unless the generator buff is about to fall off, then it will use a generator
- If using Kridershot and Meticulous Bolts, it will normally use Ball Lightning, unless the spender buff is about to fall off, then it will use a spender
* Now accounts for Companion/Raven Active Damage Bonus (500% on next attack)
* Now accounts for Discipline usage
* Many buffs that were previously averaged are now implemented discretely (e.g. wolf, MfD, other player buffs)
* Wolf in the "Other Player Buffs" panel is now only for Wolf buff from another DH and is applied separately from Wolf from the player
- The simulation will attempt to not overlap wolf buffs in order to maximize wolf uptime
* Now alternates main hand/off hand for skills that use both 
- Previously it just averaged the two
* Stat Table and Comparison Table now show difference in time to kill target (as well as the change in damage/dps)
* Health Globes are picked up based on monster health
- e.g., if "1" health globe is selected in situational panel, then it is picked up when target is ~50%. If "3" is selected, then they are picked up at ~75%, ~50%, 25% health, etc...
* Temporarily disabled features (will take some more time to test and implement):
- Spike Trap (including Helltrapper)
- Caltrops
- Area Damage
