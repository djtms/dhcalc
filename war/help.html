<h2 id="import">Importing a Hero</h2>
<img src="images/help/import.png"></img>
<ol>
<li>Select the battle.net realm from the drop-down</li>
<li>Enter the battletag in the two fields labeled "battletag" (a battletag has 2 parts: a "name" and a "number", separated by a "#" character. Enter each part separately)</li>
<li>Click "Get Hero List" to retrieve the list of heros</li>
<li>Select the hero from the drop-down list</li>
<li>Click "Import" to import the hero</li>
</ol>
This will import the hero's items and skills and run a simulation based on the profile and other input fields.<p/>
<b>Note: the battle.net API does not provide access to paragon points (except dexterity which can be calculated), so you will have to enter them manually. If you do this after hitting "Import" simply click "Simulate" to re-run the simulation. If you do this before hitting "Import" then they are already included in the simulation.</b>
<hr/>
<h2 id="how">How it Works</h2>
After importing a hero, or after clicking the "Simulate" button, the calculator will run a simulation using the data from all the input fields. The simulation will run until either:
<p/>
<ul>
<li>All targets are dead</li>
<li>The simulation time limit has expired (specified by the field "Simulation Time Limit (seconds):")</li>
</ul>
<p/>
For each tick of the simulation, it will select skills (the skill selection criteria is dependent on the build; in the future there may be more options for specifying skill selection logic), 
and determine the damage to one or more targets. You must have a primary target (e.g. a Rift Guardian) and you may have zero or more additional 
targets. At the conclusion of the simulation, the results are summarized and displayed in tables, along with a very detailed <a href="#log">Damage Log</a>.
You may also <a href="#export">export the results to Excel</a>.
<hr/>
<h2 id="output">Simulation Output</h2>
<img src="images/help/output.png"></img>
<p/>
After the simulation is complete, the results of the simulation will be displayed in the panel labeled "Output." The top of the output panel displays the total damage, damage per second and time elapsed. Additional calculated values are shown for average weapon damage for main hand and offhand/dual wield (if equipped), along with the maximum number of sentries that may be deployed and total bonus elite damage.
<p/>
Buttons across the top row provide access to
<ul>
<li><a href="#legend">Legend</a>
<li><a href="#bp">Break Points</a>
<li><a href="#skills">Skills</a>
<li><a href="#export">Export to Excel</a>
<li><a href="#about">About</a>
</ul>
<p/>
The field labeled "Simulation Time Limit (seconds):" may be used to limit (or extend) the maximum simulation time. Clicking the button labeled "Simulate" will re-run the simulation.
<p/>
Within this panel there are also several tables:
<ul>
<li><a href="#stat">Stat Calculator</a></li>
<li><a href="#damageType">Damage Type Summary</a></li>
<li><a href="#skillDamage">Skill Damage Summary</a></li>
<li><a href="#shooter">Shooter Summary</a></li>
<li><a href="#log">Damage Log</a></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="stat">Stat Calculator</h2>
<img src="images/help/stat-calc.png"></img>
<p/>
The stat calculator lists various attributes along with the effect of increasing (or decreasing) has on the total damage output. For each attribute
the table displays the total simulation time, along with percent increase/decrease from the current simulation, total damage and dps, along with percent increase/decrease
from the current simulation.
<p/>
Clicking the "+" and "-" buttons on the spinner for each attribute will immediately re-run the simulation for that attribute, displaying the results in real time.
<hr/>
<h2 id="damageType">Damage Type Summary</h2>
<img src="images/help/damage-type.png"></img>
<p/>
The damage type summary table displays, for each elemental damage type (fire, cold, lightning, physical, poison, holy, arcane) the number of "attacks" (which can also include companion/sentry attacks and item/gem procs), the average damage per attack, total damage, total damage per second and percent of the overall total.
<hr/>
<h2 id="skillDamage">Skill Damage Summary</h2>
<img src="images/help/skill-damage.png"></img>
<p/>
The skill damage summary table displays, for each skill (also includes gem and item procs) the number of "attacks", the average damage per attack, total damage, total damage per second and percent of the overall total.
<hr/>
<h2 id="shooter">Shooter Summary</h2>
<img src="images/help/shooter.png"></img>
<p/>
The shooter summary table displays, for each shooter (player, companion, sentries) the number of "attacks", the average damage per attack, total damage, total damage per second and percent of the overall total.
<hr/>

<li>Hatred: The player's total Hatred after this event</li>
<li>+/- Disc: The Discipline gain/cost from the event</li>
<li>Disc: The player's total discipline after this event</li>
<li>Damage: Damage caused (if any) by this event</li>
<li>Target HP: The target's health after this event</li>
<li>% HP: The target's percent of maximum health after this event</li>
<li>Target: Which target was hit by this event</li>
<li>Notes: various notes regarding the event (see <a href="#legend">Legend</a> for abbreviations)</li>
<li>Calculations: the damage calculations for this event (see <a href="#legend">Legend</a> for abbreviations)</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="paragon">Paragon</h2>
<img src="images/help/paragon.png"></img>
<p/>
The Paragon input panel allows you to enter the values for paragon points that affect damage output.
<p/>
<b>Note: Paragon points other than Dexterity must be entered manually (they are not available via the battle.net API). 
If you change these after importing a hero, click the "Simulate" button to update the output. If you set these before clicking "Import"
then the simulation output has used the values you provided.</b>
<p/>
As you change each value in the "offense points" section, the caclulator will update the total offense points and required paragon level in real time.
<hr/>
<h2 id="saveLoad">Save/Load</h2>

</ul>
<p/>
Damage Modifiers are combined, depending on the value of the "How Calculated" column. The possible values are:
<ul>
<li><b>Multiplicative</b>: The Damage Modifier is independently multiplicative. The value of this modifiers is multiplied against all other modifiers. For example, if the Modifier's value is X%, then the damage is multiplied by (1 + X/100).</li> 
<li><b>Additive</b>: The Damage Modifier is grouped with other Additive modifiers. The total value of all Additive modifiers is multiplied against all other modifiers.

<li><b>Elemental Additive</b>: The Damage Modifier is grouped with other Elemental Additive modifiers and Elemental Damage Bonus. The total value of all Additive modifiers is multiplied against all other modifiers. For example, if the Elemental Additive Modifier's value is X% and the Elemetal Damage Bonus is Y%, then the damage is multiplied by (1 + X/100 + Y/100).</li> 
<li><b>Special</b>: This category is for Damage Modifiers that do not fit into one of the three categories above. For example, Crit Hit Chance and Crit Hit Damage.</li>
