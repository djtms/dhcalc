**TO DO:**

* Confirm: Sentries will fire bolts only when not firing spenders? (currently assumes if a Sentry can fire X bolts over 30 seconds, and the player fires Y spenders, then the Sentry will actually fire X - Y bolts over 30 seconds)
* Confirm: Does dual-wield attack speed bonus apply to sentry breakpoint calculations?
* Confirm: Does Attack Speed on off-hand weapon apply to sentry breakpoint calculations?
* Confirm: Dual Wield Sheet APS and DPS calculations
* Confirm: Area damage is additive?
* Confirm: Crashing Rain damage applies to single target only or 12 yard radius?

* Implement Patch 2.2. changes:
- Add Convention of the Elements ring
- Add import of Nat's Slayer RoV bonus (should work as is, need to verify)
- Subtract discipline usage for UE6 bonus
- Implement breakpoints for Strafe/Rapid Fire

* Add Pierce mechanics
* Add support for remaining active damage skills (rapid fire, vengeance)
* Add support for ruby socketed in weapon(s)
* Add support for more than two spenders/generators
* re-enable player/build statistics
