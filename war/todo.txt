**TO DO:**

* Confirm: Sentries will fire bolts only when not firing spenders? (currently assumes if a Sentry can fire X bolts over 30 seconds, and the player fires Y spenders, then the Sentry will actually fire X - Y bolts over 30 seconds)
* Confirm: Does dual-wield attack speed bonus apply to sentry breakpoint calculations?
* Confirm: Does Attack Speed on off-hand weapon apply to sentry breakpoint calculations?
* Confirm: Dual Wield Sheet APS and DPS calculations
* Confirm: Area damage is additive?
* Confirm: When using Spines or Kridershot, do Chakram/Elemental Arrow get both bonuses from Bastions of Will, or only the Generator bonus?
* Confirm: Bastions of Will bonuses are multiplicative

* Implement Patch 2.2. changes:
- Add Max Discipline from skills
- Add Convention of the Elements ring
- Add Crashing Rain belt
- Add Nat's Slayer RoV bonus (should work as is, need to verify)
- Add 2.2 Nat's set bonuses
- Add UE Set bonuses

* Add support ruby socketed in weapon(s)
* Add support for more than two spenders/generators
* re-enable player/build statistics
