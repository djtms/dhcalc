**TO DO:**

* Confirm: Does M6 bonus also apply to sentry spenders/generators or only those from player? (currently assumes only to player)
* Confirm: M6 bonus is Multiplicative? (currently assumes yes)
* Confirm: Sentries will fire bolts only when not firing spenders? (currently assumes if a Sentry can fire X bolts over 30 seconds, and the player fires Y spenders, then the Sentry will actually fire X - Y bolts over 30 seconds)

* Add configurable delays between player firing? 
* Add support for more spenders/generators
* Add Reaper's Wraps and Health Globes (for hatred)
* Add cooldown skills (e.g. Rain of Vengeance)
* re-enable player/build statistics
* Import hatred regen from items/skills
* Add Oddesey's End 
* Support dual wield for hand crossbows
* Check other set bonuses that need import logic to handle royal ring
* Improve logic for selecting # of AoE targets
* Verify/fix Chakram targeting logic
* Add Companion dps
* Improve ability to compare damage/dps between multiple builds
* Add build recommendations based on gear
* Add undo
* Model monster HP and fight duration
* Add translation/localization
* Improve appearance (colors, styles, etc....)
* Add skill/rune icons
